## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- [x] Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
- [x] Where k and the length of the list are the same
- [x] Where k is not a positive integer
- [x] Where the linked list is of a size 1
- [x] “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
